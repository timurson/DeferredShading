# DeferredShading
Experimentation with doing deferred rendering using OpenGL.  I implemented this project almost entirely from scratch starting with a basic GLFW OpenGL framework and Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) for model loading.
I was already familiar with a concept of deferred shading from attending various GDC lectures in the past, but have not had a chance to really experiment with deferred lighting until now. Attempting to simulate thousands of local area lights in the scene is a pretty fascinating endeavor and I am really glad I had an opportunity to do that in this project.

## Features:
*  Support for rendering into multiple render targets using OpenGLâ€™s frame buffer objects that I ended up wrapping into a custom class for ease of use.
*  Support for over a thousand (possibly more) local area lights that are being rendered as spherical volumes.
*  Blinn-Phong lighting calculation is being applied during the initial deferred global light with shadows pass and the final area lights rendering stage.
*  Used various Stanford 3D Models: Bunny, Lucy, Dragon, and others.
*  Utilizing Dear ImGui graphical user interface library for easy real-time debugging and configuration
